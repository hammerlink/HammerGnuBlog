# Introduction

I have an interest in radio technology.

In this personal blog / repo I am teaching myself more about the subject.

Used tools:

- GNURadio Companion, is an open source tool that allows you to analyze and produce radiowaves.
- HackRF device, this is hardware able to transmit and receive radio signals.


# FM-stream (2023-07-23)

The simplest method of working with radio signals would be working with the radio.
At home I have a simple JBL radio that works with both FM & DAB+ signals.

My goal is to play music / other sounds onto the radio.
